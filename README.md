# htsdb: library and tools to handle Hith Throughput Sequencing data stored in SQLite database.

Given a database table with a schema similar to a SAM file this library
provides a convenient interface to iterate over the records in the database
and perform custom queries. For usage examples see available tools.

Note: The API is in early alpha and therefore very unstable. Things change
frequently.
